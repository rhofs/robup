// Web Vibration API — no native app needed, but real platform limits: Chrome/Android supports it
// (including installed PWAs) and Safari/iOS has never implemented it at all (WebKit has no
// navigator.vibrate, in Safari or in an iOS PWA — a long-standing Apple platform decision, not a
// missing permission or a bug here). This is a pure best-effort enhancement: it silently no-ops
// everywhere unsupported (iOS, desktop, an older Android WebView) rather than throwing, so calling
// it is always safe regardless of platform.
//
// Note for anyone debugging "haptics don't work" on a device that *should* support them: Android's
// Do Not Disturb / bedtime mode suppresses vibration system-wide, and it silently affects
// navigator.vibrate too — worth ruling out before looking at this file.
